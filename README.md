# Task Manager

This is a simple task manager application built with React and TypeScript. It is for my family to schedule the things
we need to do and have it added to our Google Calendar. It is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
and can be accessed [here](https://wifey-task-manager.netlify.app). My wife asked for it and I built it for her.

To use the application, you need to sign in with your Google account.
This is to enable the application to add events to your Google Calendar on your behalf. You also need to shoot me an
email at [ekeenyinnaya@gmail.com](mailto:ekeenyinnaya@gmail.com) to add you to the list of users who can use the application.
I do not have the time to verify the app on Google, so I have to add you manually as a tester.
